General visualization tools typically require manual specification of views:
analysts must select data variables and then choose which transformations and
visual encodings to apply. These decisions often involve both domain and
visualization design expertise, and may impose a tedious specification process
that impedes exploration. In this paper, we seek to complement manual chart
construction with interactive navigation of a gallery of automatically-generated
visualizations. We contribute Voyager, a mixed-initiative system that supports
faceted browsing of recommended charts chosen according to statistical and
perceptual measures. We describe Voyager's architecture, motivating design
principles, and methods for generating and interacting with visualization
recommendations. In a study comparing Voyager to a manual visualization
specification tool, we find that Voyager facilitates exploration of previously
unseen data and leads to increased data variable coverage. We then distill
design implications for visualization tools, in particular the need to balance
rapid exploration and targeted question-answering.
