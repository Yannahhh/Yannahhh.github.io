# Hi, I'm Yanna Lin

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

<div class="intro" markdown="1">

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Waterloo, working with [Prof. Jian Zhao](https://www.jeffjianzhao.com) in the [WVisdom research lab](https://www.jeffjianzhao.com/team).

Before joining Waterloo, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher and obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://www.huamin.org) in the [VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk). 
My Ph.D. was supported by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) and recognized with the [HKUST RedBird Academic Excellence Award](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/admissions/Admission-to-Hong-Kong-Campus/submitting-an-application/scholarships-and-fees) for three consecutive years.
I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Software Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University, ranked 1/447.
During my undergraduate studies, I was honored with the National Scholarship for three consecutive years (top 0.5%).

My research interests include data visualisation and human-AI collaboration. I focus on designing intuitive interfaces and developing algorithms to enhance data communication and analysis, and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
